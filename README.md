# Readmission prediction via deep contextual embedding of clinical concepts

This repository is the experimental re-implementation of Readmission prediction via deep contextual embedding of clinical concepts(https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195024#sec022) for our group project. 

Group members: Christopher Wong , Franco Hui

## Requirements

This project is executed via Google Colab.

The simulation data used in the experiment can be download from the section of 'Supporting Information' of authors' publication page at https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195024#sec022


## Training & Evaluation

To evalute our model on Google Colab, you may run our program from DLH_Project(Paper_232).ipynb via the Google Colab. 

CONTENT_theano.ipynb is our first attempt to reproduce the experiment with the libraries of Theano that is no longer supported by the developers.
